March/April end-of-month review
===

(written 28-30 April)

The end of April marked an important time in my project. I have decided that
one of the reasons why I am not making much headway is because I am trying to
tackle too much at once. Therefore in order to combat this, I am scaling down
the size of my project.

The timeline has been updated to reflect the reduction in scale. An additional
change is that the objectives for May and June have been made more concrete, so
I know what I'm aiming for. Additionally, time estimates have been added to the
tasks on the timeline. I am ideally aiming to spend one hour per day on my EP
on average over the coming two weeks; this gives me 30 hours to allocate per
month on my timeline. This has helped to see what could ideally be done in two
months of solid work; however I am allowing some flexibility in order to
prioritise my exams.

Overview of this month's progress on the (original) timeline:

**Unfinished from February**:

  *Targets*:
  * Start a prototype of fluid simulation (done 7/3/13)

**End of March**:

  *Targets*:
  * Create landscape meshes (not done)
  * Improve on fluid simulation (done)


**End of April**:

  *Targets*:
  * Finish a prototype of 3D fluid simulation (not done)
  * Assess the result (with initial feedback from others) (not done)
