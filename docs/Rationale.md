Rationale
=========

I am trying to make a computer program which is a realtime 3D demonstration of physics and graphics. I wanted to make something where the process of creating is a technically challenging experience for me, but the outcome is presented as a demo which can be appreciated and enjoyable by everyone.

I do a lot of programming in my free time, so I think that this is a good way to see how far I can stretch my programming skills. Additionally I get the chance to explore and experiment with two fields of computer science (computational graphics and physics) that I have not previously had any experience in. If I successfully complete this project then I will have learnt a lot about how to efficiently calculate physics and 3D graphics on a modern computer. Additionally I will learn about the artistic side of creating a 3D animation.
