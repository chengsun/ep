May/June end-of-month review
===

(written 30 June)

This month I have tried to implement a half-edge-based mesh system, in order to
represent my 3D waves and scenery. However, this is entirely new to me, and I
am finding it very hard to visualise and implement the operations on this
system correctly. I am quite disappointed at the lack of progress on this.

I have successfully made a 2D prototype of Verlet integration in order to
demonstrate ragdoll physics. This was very success in my opinion, and used
parts of mathematics and physics that I had already learnt, coupled with the
"Verlet integration" technique which I learnt from a
[web page][democritis verlet], and a line segment collision algorithm that I
found in a book (Graphics Gems, page 304). See my diary for details (and
pictures).

As I do not expect that I will have very much time at all over the summer (I
have summer schools during July and family holidays in August, meaning that I
will have only three free weeks during the two weeks) I have revised my
Timeline in order to reflect this.
