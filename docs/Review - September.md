September end-of-project review
===

(written 7 October)

This month I have successfully tied up all the loose ends with my artefact
project.

Issues with my bridge simulation game from last month have been resolved. In
the end I could not find any good sources, so I had to work out how to achieve
this myself.

Finally, I implemented Blinn-Phong lighting. I used the knowledge of diffuse
shading I gained when researching and coding my `cube` JavaScript experiment in
April, and additional research on specular lighting in order to implement a
realistic 3D lighting shading for my wave simulation.

I am delighted with the outcomes of my projects.
