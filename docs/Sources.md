## Graphics Gems Line Intersection algorithm

**Date**:
30/6/13

**Resource**:
Goldman, R. (1990) Intesection of Two Lines in Three-Space. In Glassner, A.
(ed.) *Graphics Gems* Academic Press Inc.

**Description**:

**Objective**:

I want to find out when a ragdoll limb collides with an obstacle.  
In order to do this, I need to find out about how I could calculate whether two
line segments intersect in 2D space.

**Key points**:

* I discovered a calculation that I could do in order to find whether two line
  segments intersect in 3D space.

**Cross references**:

The algorithm outlined in this source was referenced from one of my other
sources, Stack Overflow, a community question-and-answer website.  


**Reliability**:

The Graphics Gems book has a very good reputation in the graphics community for
being of high quality.  
In addition, I implemented the algorithm and it worked, which attests to this
source's validity.

**Future work**:

I need to rewrite the equations in terms of 2D rather than 3D.

I need to implement the algorithm to test whether it works correctly.  


## Codeflow Verlet

**Date**:
17/6/13

**Resource**:
* Boesch, F. (2010) Hard Constraints, Easy Solutions. *Codeflow*. Weblog.
  Available from:
  <http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/sep/01/hard-constraints-easy-solutions/>
  [Accessed: 23th September 2013]

**Description**:

This is a blog post written by Florian Boesch, which includes live
demonstrations of a physics simulation method called Verlet integration.


**Objective**:

I wanted to find out whether fast realistic physics was possible to achieve
with a computer simulation.


**Key points**:

The article was very useful in showing me that Verlet integration could
potentially be what I am looking for:

* Physics simulation is feasible, even with a low amount of computation power
  available.
* Physics objects have to be modelled as particles joined together with
  "constraints".
* The Verlet integration scheme has been shown to be successful, being stable
  and realistic.

**Reliability**:

This is a blog post by a software enthusiast, so it in itself is not
necessarily reliable. However, the live demonstrations that were on the page
worked, and were convincing. I would use this blog post as a starting point for
my investigations into Verlet integration.


**Future work**:

I need to investigate how exactly this was done, and the mathematics behind it.
Although some code examples were given on the page, they were incomplete and
not detailed enough for me to implement this myself.  
I need to find other sources to verify that Verlet integration is suitable, and
which kinds of constraints can be used with the integration scheme.



## Thomas Jakobsen's Advanced Character Physics

**Date**:
25/06/13

**Resource**:
Jakobsen, T. (2001) Advanced Character Physics. *Game Developer's Conference
2001* Available from:
<http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm>
[Accessed: 22/09/13]

**Description**:

This is a paper written by Thomas Jakobsen, published for the Game Developer's
Conference 2001. Jakobsen is a professional mathematician and programmer, who
wrote the physics engine for the videogame "Hitman: Codename 47", which
revolutionised how ragdoll physics would be calculated in future games.
Jakobsen popularised the use of Verlet integration in order to drastically
reduce the amount of computation power required to simulate a ragdoll, and
increase the realism and stability of the simulation at the same time.

**Objective**:

I was hoping to find out about techniques I could use to accurately simulate
physics.


**Key points**:

* Verlet integration is not 100% accurate, some energy can leave the system.
* The core mathematics required is introduced.

**Reliability**:

This is a primary source, written by a leading programmer himself about his own
creation. I have found many online sources that refer to and cite this
publication. This leads me to trust this source as relevant and reliable.  
In addition I have tried the technique outlined in the paper in my "Verlet"
experiments, and they have all been very successful.


**Cross-references**:

I arrived at this source after it was referenced as the fundamental Verlet
integration source from several places across the internet.
The information in this source connects with the information I had found in
the Codeflow blog post and the Democritus introduction to Verlet, as they agree
on the key underlying formula.


OpenGL Programming Guide (Red Book)
===

**Date**:
13/08/13

**Resource**:
Shreiner, D. et al. (1997) *OpenGL Programming Guide: The Official Guide to
Learning OpenGL, Version 1.1*. 2nd edition. Addison-Wesley Publishing.

**Description**:

This book is the official guide to OpenGL. It contains tutorials and examples
on the key parts of OpenGL and graphics programming.


**Objective**:

I was aiming to find out about "matrix stacks": what they were and how I could
use them to represent transformations on groups of objects in 3D space.


**Key points**:

* I discovered what matrix stacks were.


**Reliability**:

This is an official guide written by the OpenGL Architecture 
This is a primary source, written by a leading programmer himself about his own
creation. I have found many online sources that refer to and cite this
publication. This leads me to trust this source as relevant and reliable.  
In addition I have tried the technique outlined in the paper in my "Verlet"
experiments, and they have all been very successful.


**Cross-references**:

The code examples in the book did not match up with those in other sources,
such as McKesson's OpenGL tutorial. I discovered that this is because the code
in this source was written using a deprecated style called immediate mode.
Modern OpenGL no longer uses this, so I ignored the code examples in this
source and focused only on the concepts and mathematics.
