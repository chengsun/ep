January end-of-month review
===

(written 19/02/2013, 04/03/2013)

This month saw the start of my extended project. At the beginning, I still had
little idea of exactly what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I wanted to
experiment with computer graphics. I started off experimenting in
Blender, a free and open-source 3D modelling software, and evaluated whether
making an animation in Blender would make for a feasible extended project.
However, very quickly I discovered that I wanted to program my own 3D graphics,
and not simply use existing software to create graphics. (I also discovered
that I was not very good at making 3D graphics in an art package!)

I am influenced by the demoscene

Realtime code is a challenge

Read my Rationale

In order to hardware accelerate my rendering, I needed to learn OpenGL, which
is a library and specification for graphics cards to render objects.

I also had a look at the many fluid simulation techniques.
