January end-of-month review
===

(written 19 January, 4 March, 28 April)

This month saw the start of my extended project. At the beginning, I still had
little idea of exactly what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I wanted to
experiment with computer graphics. I started off experimenting in
Blender, a free and open-source 3D modelling software, and evaluated whether
making an animation in Blender would make for a feasible extended project.
However, very quickly I discovered that I wanted to program my own 3D graphics,
and not simply use existing software to create graphics. (I also discovered
that I was not very good at making 3D graphics in an art package!)

In order to hardware accelerate my rendering, I needed to learn OpenGL, which
is a library and specification for graphics cards to render objects. I have
started to learn how to use this, through online resources. I also had a look
at the many fluid simulation techniques, in papers published online. Many are
far too complicated for my purposes, however this process has given me an idea
of what is feasible and what is not during the time that I have.

Overall this month helped to define the purpose of my project; I now know the
direction that I want to take. Additionally some initial basic code was
written.
