January end-of-month review
===

This month saw the start of my extended project. At the beginning, I still had little idea of exactly what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I wanted to experiment with computer graphics. I started off experimenting in [Blender][blender], a free and open-source 3D modelling software, and evaluated whether making an animation in Blender would make for a feasible extended project. However, very quickly I discovered that I wanted to program my own 3D graphics, and not simply use existing software to create graphics. (I also discovered that I was not very good at making 3D graphics in an art package!)
