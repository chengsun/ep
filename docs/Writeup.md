## AO1 -- management

### Planning

I had anticipated that learning OpenGL would be a
massive endeavour. This is why I decided to start my project as soon as
possible, tackling smaller sub-projects that help me to get to grips with it.

Right from the beginning before I had even started writing any code, I
carefully planned my program, structuring it into three pieces. The “player”
would be designed to create the window in which the program could draw. It
loading everything up and managed mouse clicks and keyboard presses. The
“library” would be a set of useful and reusable code, such as mesh management,
texture and lighting code, that I could use in each of my sub-projects without
having redundant copy-and-pasted code everywhere. Finally the “scenes” would be
individual small pieces of code that did the things specific to each
sub-project.

## AO2 -- research

My research encompassed a large range of sources. As my artefact
is mostly computer-based, most of the relevant information that I have found
has been on the internet. However, this web-based information has taken the
forms of blog posts, research papers. Videos of presentations given at
conferences have also come in very useful.

My sources have mostly been factual
or outlined procedures on how to achieve things using different programming
techniques. They have mostly been independent of each other, however where
there has been overlap they have been in agreement, and often they have even
cross-referenced each other. For example, the Valve paper on text rendering
