    try making this iron platform not collapse

Toby Shaw
    XD
    Okay this is hard
    [...]
    Did you deliberately make that bridge asymmetrical?
    Because one side of it breaks and the other side doesn't grr
    [...]
    How the fuck do you get the left iron bar not to break? I just don't get it

Toby Shaw
    Hahaha
    This design has been trolling me

    3 seconds wait before it breaks.

Cheng Sun
bahaha
I'm not sure why it spontaneously breaks
might be a bug

Toby Shaw
ehh..
I'll admit defeat

[...]

Toby Shaw
also they keep swinging forever

Cheng Sun
no, it doesn't

Toby Shaw
fine, for like 10 mins

Cheng Sun
there's very little air resistance
but
this is an ideal world, remember


[...]


Toby Shaw
Is it possible to make one entirely out of iron?
I'm having difficulties

Cheng Sun
dunno

Toby Shaw
OH its easy

I gave up after building a massive contraption that almost worked
and then pasted yours in

Toby Shaw
I got an iron/cable bridge to hold a steel crate

I think (?) things have weight in this right?

Cheng Sun
yep
iron is ridiculously heavy
hence, why it sucks
nice build btw


[...]


Cheng Sun
it's because cables are OP

Toby Shaw
Basically, iron is shit.

Cheng Sun
I should rename it plastic or something

Toby Shaw
Hahaha

Cheng Sun
I really need to tweak the material parameters
they seem a bit unbalanced

Toby Shaw
Yea.. it's completely broken atm

[...]

Cheng Sun
oh I know why iron spontaneously snaps
physics bug
kinda

[...]

Toby Shaw
Haha, cya.
Nice job on the simulator btw
very impressive

Toby Shaw
btw your bottom triangle in your 'solution' is redundant

Just requires intense positioning

Cheng Sun
Haha,neat I'm on my phone right npw so can't check it
Can you do it if the iron bridge is split into four segments instead of three?

Toby Shaw
I assume that would make it easier

Cheng Sun
Orly

Toby Shaw
I showed you earlier that you could have a free-standing iron bridge if it was in 5-6 sections
it acts more wire-like and is less prone to snapping

Cheng Sun
Oh yeah, true

Toby Shaw
Since if it was 1 section it'd be next to impossible.

Cheng Sun
Damn it you know more about my game than I do blue
Now *

Toby Shaw
wait wait wait
no I was wrong.
a single iron bar is completely stable.

Cheng Sun
I fixed it

Toby Shaw
oh lovely.

Cheng Sun
Four is harder if the iron bars are all in a line

Toby Shaw
ah okay, so now spontaneous snapping isn't the major issue of iron, potentially dividing it further will result in less stability?

Cables op

Cheng Sun
Hmm, yes
I need to nerf that

[...]

Toby Shaw
did you see I finished your game?
supported the iron bridge with only iron and not the top 2 points.

Cheng Sun
Wait, with only iron?

Check it for yourself.
It's a work of art.

Cheng Sun
that's, like, physically impossible bro
wtf
time to fix my code methinks

Toby Shaw
nonono it was near-impossible to get that
iron is incredibly broken and awful

Cheng Sun
hahaha
yes, it's rusty iron you see

Toby Shaw
I just think leave iron there as 'hard-mode'
[...]
just rename it 'brittle plastic'
