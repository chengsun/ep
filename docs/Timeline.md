Timeline plan
=============

* **End of January**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams and coursework may leave me short of time.

  *Targets*:
  * Decide on, and have an overall knowledge on, the method of fluid dynamics simulation to use.
  * Start work on the mesh code.


* **End of February**:

  *Targets*:
  * Make a working demo of the mesh renderer.
  * Start a prototype of fluid simulation


* **End of March**:

  *Targets*:
  * Create landscape meshes
  * Improve on fluid simulation


* **End of April**:

  *Targets*:
  * Finish a prototype of fluid simulation
  * Assess the result (with initial feedback from others)


* **End of May**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams will leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Improve on fluid simulation (change tack if prototype not successful)


* **End of June**:

  *Targets*:
  * Improve on fluid simulation
  * Add fluid effects
  * Add mesh scenery
  * Assess the result (with feedback from others)


* **End of July**:

  *Considerations*:
  Summer holidays

  *Targets*:
  * Finish fluid simulation
  * Polish demo: add effects and decorations
  * Look for / try to make some accompanying music?


* **End of August**:

  *Considerations*:
  Summer holidays

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo: add effects


* **End of September**:

  *Considerations*:
  UCAS applications may leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo


* **End of October**:

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo
  * Final submission
