Timeline plan
=============

(Timeline created 14 January)

**End of January**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams and coursework may leave me short of time.

  *Targets*:
  * Decide on, and have an overall knowledge on, the method of fluid dynamics simulation to use. (done)
  * Start work on the mesh code. (done)


**End of February**:

  *Targets*:
  * Make a working demo of the mesh renderer. (done)
  * Start a prototype of fluid simulation (done, 7 March)


**End of March**:

  *Targets*:
  * Improve on fluid simulation (done)


**End of April**:

  *Targets*:
  * Research the method of cloth simulation to use (done)


(Timeline revised 30 April from this point onwards)

**End of May**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams will leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Implement tessellated grid mesh (est. 6 hours)
  * Implement constraints for mesh (est. 6 hours)
  * Implement verlet integration (est. 6 hours)
  * Create prototype of 3D cloth simulation using above (est. 10 hours)
  * Create prototype of 3D fluid simulation using above (est. 4 hours)


**End of June**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams will leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Implement camera perspective (est. 6 hours)
  * Implement octrees (est. 12 hours)
  * Cloth simulation collision detection using octrees (est. 8 hours)
  * Assess the result (with initial feedback from others)


**End of July**:

  *Considerations*:
  Summer schools will leave me short of time (only two weeks in this month!)

  *Targets*:
  * Improve on fluid simulation
  * Add fluid effects
  * Improve on cloth simulation
  * Assess the result (with feedback from others)


**End of August**:

  *Targets*:
  * Finish fluid simulation
  * Polish demo: add effects and decorations
  * Look for / try to make some accompanying music?


**End of September**:

  *Considerations*:
  UCAS applications may leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo


**October**:

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo
 
**Final submission by the second week of October**
