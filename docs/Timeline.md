Timeline plan
=============

(Timeline created 14 January)

**End of January**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams and coursework may leave me short of time.

  *Targets*:
  * Decide on, and have an overall knowledge on, the method of fluid dynamics simulation to use. (done)
  * Start work on the mesh code. (done)


**End of February**:

  *Targets*:
  * Make a working demo of the mesh renderer. (done)
  * Start a prototype of fluid simulation (done, 7 March)


**End of March**:

  *Targets*:
  * Improve on fluid simulation (done)


**End of April**:

  *Targets*:
  * Research the method of cloth simulation to use (done)


(Timeline revised 30 April from this point onwards)


**End of May/June**:

  *Considerations*:
  Exams will leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Research linear algebra, representing 3D points and transformations as vectors, matrices and quaternions (done)
  * Implement grid mesh (est. 6 hours) (done)


(Timeline revised 17 June from this point onwards)


**End of July**:

  *Considerations*:
  Summer schools will leave me short of time (only two weeks in this month!)

  *Targets*: 
  * Implement verlet integration (est. 6 hours) (done)
  * Create prototype of 3D fluid simulation (est. 4 hours)

**End of August**:

  *Considerations*:
  Summer arrangements: I will only have one free week in August

  *Targets*:
  * Implement camera perspective (est. 4 hours) (done)
  * Review sources used and start writing up evaluations


**End of September**:

  *Considerations*:
  University applications may leave me short of time

  *Targets*:
  * Assess the result (with feedback from others)
  * Polish demo: add effects and decorations
  * Prepare presentation


**October**:

  *Targets*:
  * Polish demo
  * Finish presentation


**Final submission by the second week of October**
