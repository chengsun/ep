Thomas Jakobsen's Advanced Character Physics

Paper URL: http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm

This is a paper written by Thomas Jakobsen, published for the Game Developer's
Conference 2001. Jakobsen is a professional mathematician and programmer, who
wrote the physics engine for the videogame "Hitman: Codename 47", which
revolutionised how ragdoll physics would be calculated in future games.
Jakobsen repopularised the use of Verlet integration in order to drastically
reduce the amount of computation power required to simulate a ragdoll, and
increase the realism and stability of the simulation at the same time.

This is a primary source, written by a leading programmer himself about his own
creation. I have found many online sources that refer to and cite this
publication. This leads me to trust this source as relevant and reliable. In
addition I have tried the technique outlined in the paper in my "Verlet"
experiments, and they have all been very successful.
